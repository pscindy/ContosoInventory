 # Service Layer Standards

 - Define a corresponding interface for every service class (e.g., IProductService for ProductService).
 - Use async/await for all I/O-bound operations (database calls, HTTP requests, file I/O).
 - Accept and return DTOs, not database entities.
 - Include comprehensive input validation at the start of each public method.
 - Throw specific exception types (ArgumentException, InvalidOperationException) rather than generic Exception.
 - Log significant operations using ILogger<T> with structured logging parameters.
