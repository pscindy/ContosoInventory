 # API Controller Standards

 - Inherit from ControllerBase and apply the [ApiController] attribute.
 - Use attribute routing with [Route("api/[controller]")] on the class.
 - Keep controller methods thin: delegate business logic to service classes.
 - Use action-specific attributes: [HttpGet], [HttpPost], [HttpPut], [HttpDelete].
 - Return IActionResult or ActionResult<T> from all action methods.
 - Include [ProducesResponseType] attributes to document response types.
 - Validate model state using data annotations on request DTOs.
 - Inject services through the constructor, not directly in action methods.
