 # Contoso Inventory API - Coding Standards

 ## Naming Conventions
 - Use PascalCase for class names, public methods, and public properties.
 - Use camelCase for local variables and method parameters.
 - Prefix private fields with an underscore (e.g., _inventoryService).
 - Suffix interface names with the interface prefix "I" (e.g., IInventoryService).

 ## Architecture Patterns
 - Follow the repository pattern for all data access operations.
 - Use dependency injection for all service dependencies. Register services in Program.cs.
 - Separate business logic into service classes. Controllers should only handle HTTP concerns.
 - Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for API request and response payloads. Never expose database entities directly.

 ## Error Handling
 - Use try-catch blocks for all external API calls and database operations.
 - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
 - Log all exceptions using ILogger<T> with structured logging.
 - Include meaningful error messages in API responses.

 ## Documentation
 - Include XML documentation comments on all public methods and classes.
 - Use inline comments only for complex business logic that is not self-explanatory.

 ## Testing
 - Write unit tests using xUnit and Moq.
 - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test methods.
 - Name test methods using the pattern: MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult.
